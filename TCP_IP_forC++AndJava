Was able to look into how difficult it was to create a client/server communication, from sending simple text strings or files.
After researching it, C++ would limit us more than Java. Java also has more powerful/easy options to get a connection as well as polling at set intervals.
my recommendation is to go forward with Java for both the client and server application.
