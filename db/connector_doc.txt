Documentation to setup mysql and run the connector.

Notes:
This is on a local machine, using linux (Anything DEB based should work).
If run on a different machine, different root password is needed. I'm using 'kelpians'
This connector will only work with the DB / tables / columns I have setup for testing. More info below.
Current functionality includes static queries/inserts/updates/deletes.

Installations:
  sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
  sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client libmysql-java
  Install Platform Independent TAR from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/
  Move mysql-connector-java-8.0.17.jar from above TAR into working directory

Commands to setup specific testing DB used in connector class:
  mysql -u root -p
    - Enter password
  create database test;
  show databases;
    - Check that db was created
  use test;
  create table fake_data(
    -> id int auto_increment primary key,
    -> name char(20) not null
    -> );
  show tables;
    - Check that table was created
  insert into fake_data values(1, "alex");
  select * from fake_data;
    -Check that data was added
  exit;

Compile:
  javac java-filename.java

Run:
  java -cp .:mysql-connector-java-8.0.17.jar Connector
