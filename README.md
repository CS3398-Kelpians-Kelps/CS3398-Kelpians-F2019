# sendIt
Alex Key, Asa Murphy, Chassidy Foreman, Patrick Parker, Zachary Goldberg
We want to create a desktop application that will allow users to send files in between devices.<br>
The target group could be for students and the general working class who may need to transfer data between work stations.<br>
We are doing this because we feel like transferring data via email is a hinderence to an individuals productivity and effieicency at getting work done.<br>
