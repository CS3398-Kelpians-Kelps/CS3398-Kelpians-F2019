# sendIt
Alex Key, Asa Murphy, Chassidy Foreman, Patrick Parker, Zachary Goldberg<br>
We want to create a desktop application that will allow users to send files in between devices.<br>
The target group could be for students and the general working class who may need to transfer data between work stations.<br>
We are doing this because we feel like transferring data via email is a hinderence to an individuals productivity and effieicency at getting work done.<br>

## Accomplishments
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asa Murphy:</strong> Developed the user home GUI and responsible for implementing computer directory accessbility, and linking text GUI            feature.</li>
  <li>
  <strong>Alex Key:</strong> All files inside db directory were done by Alex Key. This includes the connector.java, as well as the connector_doc.txt. A mySQL database was setup on my local machine to test the connector, but theres no code for that. The artifact is used for querying / inserting / updating / deleting table columns in our database. My next step will be to install and setup the db on our server, as soon as the server is ready.
